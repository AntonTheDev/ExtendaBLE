## Asking Questions
GitHub is not used as as a support forum.
For any usage questions that are not specific to the project itself,
please ask on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) instead.
By doing so, you'll be more likely to quickly solve your problem,
and you'll allow anyone else with the same question to find the answer.
This also allows maintainers to focus on improving the project for others.


## Reporting Issues

A great way to contribute to the project
is to send a detailed issue when you encounter an problem.
We always appreciate a well-written, thorough bug report.

Check that the project issues database
doesn't already include that problem or suggestion before submitting an issue.
If you find a match, add a quick "+1" or "I have this problem too."
Doing this helps prioritize the most common problems and requests.

When reporting issues, please include the following:

* The version of Xcode you're using
* The version of iOS  you are targeting
* The full output of any stack trace or compiler error
* A code snippet that reproduces the described behavior, if applicable
* Any other details that would be useful in understanding the problem

This information will help in reviewing and fix your issue faster.

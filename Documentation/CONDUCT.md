# Code of Conduct

The Code of Conduct governs how we behave in public or in private
whenever the project will be judged by our actions.
We expect it to be honored by everyone who represents the project
officially or informally,
claims affiliation with the project,
or participates directly.

We strive to:

* **Be open**: We invite anybody to participate in any aspect of our projects.
  Our community is open, and any responsibility can be carried
  by any contributor who demonstrates the required capacity and competence.
* **Be empathetic**: We work together to resolve conflict,
  assume good intentions,
  and do our best to act in an empathic fashion.
  By understanding that humanity drops a few packets in online interactions,
  and adjusting accordingly,
  we can create a comfortable environment for everyone to share their ideas.
* **Be collaborative**: We prefer to work transparently
  and to involve interested parties early on in the process.
  Wherever possible, we work closely with others in the open source community
  to coordinate our efforts.
* **Be decisive**: We expect participants in the project to resolve disagreements constructively.
  When they cannot, we escalate the matter to structures
  with designated leaders to arbitrate and provide clarity and direction.
* **Be responsible**: We hold ourselves accountable for our actions.
  When we make mistakes, we take responsibility for them.
  When we need help, we reach out to others.
  When it comes time to move on from a project,
  we take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where we left off.

This code is not exhaustive or complete.
It serves to distill our common understanding of a
collaborative, shared environment and goals.
We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.
